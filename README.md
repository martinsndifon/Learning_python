This repository contains personal python scripts that were generated in the
course of my learning the language, the scripts here in do not tell my ability
in the usage of the language.

The files here are meant for my personal reference only.

Head over to the alx-higher_level_programming repository if you're looking for
any valuable resources on python. 

Cheers!
